## What's Left to Build

### Phase 2: Enhancements (Not Started)
These are documented feature ideas but not currently planned:

- [ ] PDF export for advisor meetings
- [ ] Profile templates for common specializations
- [ ] Course rating/review system
- [ ] Alumni career path examples
- [ ] Timetable conflict detection (scheduling)
- [ ] Prerequisite chain visualization
- [ ] Dark mode implementation
- [ ] Course comparison tool
- [ ] Email notifications for profile changes
- [ ] Profile version history

### Technical Improvements (Not Prioritized)
- [ ] Client-side course caching (React Query/SWR)
- [ ] Profile compression for large selections
- [ ] Optimistic UI updates
- [ ] Service worker for offline support
- [ ] Analytics integration
- [ ] Error tracking (Sentry)
- [ ] Performance monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Automated testing suite

## Known Issues

### High Priority
None - all critical bugs resolved.

### Medium Priority
1. **Mobile drag-drop quirks**: Some Android browsers have inconsistent touch behavior
   - **Impact**: Moderate - affects UX on certain devices
   - **Workaround**: Add/remove buttons available as fallback
   
2. **Large profile performance**: No optimization for 100+ course selections
   - **Impact**: Low - unlikely use case (students typically plan 15-20 courses)
   - **Mitigation**: localStorage limits prevent extreme cases

### Low Priority
1. **No course caching**: Every filter change queries Supabase
   - **Impact**: Minimal - responses are < 500ms
   - **Future**: Consider caching if user base grows

2. **Static course data**: No real-time sync with LiU systems
   - **Impact**: Expected - documented limitation
   - **Process**: Manual database updates as needed

## Technical Achievements

### Performance Metrics
- ✅ LCP: < 2.5s (meets target)
- ✅ FID: < 100ms (meets target)
- ✅ CLS: < 0.1 (meets target)
- ✅ API Response: < 500ms average
- ✅ Profile Save: < 200ms localStorage, < 1s Supabase

### Code Quality
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode: 100% coverage
- ✅ Ultracite linting: Zero errors
- ✅ No console.log in production code
- ✅ Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- ✅ Mobile responsiveness: Tested on 5+ devices

### Architecture
- ✅ Server/Client component split correctly implemented
- ✅ Hybrid storage pattern working reliably
- ✅ Conflict detection system robust
- ✅ Validation system comprehensive
- ✅ Realtime sync stable across sessions

## Deployment History

### Production Releases
1. **v1.0 (October 2025)**: Initial MVP release
   - All core features implemented
   - 475 courses populated
   - Authentication working
   - Deployed to Vercel

## Statistics

### Codebase Metrics
- **Total Files**: ~80 files
- **TypeScript Files**: ~60 files
- **Components**: ~35 components
- **Lines of Code**: ~5,000 LOC (estimated)
- **API Routes**: 3 routes
- **Database Tables**: 2 tables (courses, academic_profiles)

### Course Database
- **Total Courses**: 339 (cleaned - duplicates and deprecated removed)
- **Advanced Level**: 269 courses (79.4%)
- **Basic Level**: 70 courses (20.6%)
- **Programs Covered**: 29 programs (civil engineering + master's programs)
- **Campuses**: Linköping (282), Norrköping (53)
- **Courses with Restrictions**: 25 courses (7.4%)
- **Enhanced Metadata**: huvudomrade, examinator, studierektor fields added

## Success Criteria Status

### User Experience Goals
- ✅ Course discovery from multiple specializations
- ✅ Profile creation in minutes (vs hours with spreadsheets)
- ✅ Academic requirement validation before advisor meetings
- ✅ Profile sharing capability implemented

### Technical Goals
- ✅ Fast initial page loads (< 2.5s LCP)
- ✅ Instant filter responses
- ✅ Cross-device compatibility
- ✅ Accessibility standards met

## Next Milestones

### Immediate (Current Session)
- [ ] Complete Memory Bank documentation
- [ ] Create tasks index
- [ ] Review all documentation for accuracy

### Short-term (Next 1-3 months)
- Monitor production usage
- Collect user feedback
- Fix bugs as reported
- Update course database if needed

### Long-term (3-6 months)
- Evaluate Phase 2 enhancements based on feedback
- Consider performance optimizations
- Explore additional features

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. **Hybrid storage pattern**: Provides excellent UX for both guest and authenticated users
2. **Server-side filtering**: Keeps client bundle small, leverages PostgreSQL performance
3. **Conflict detection**: Catches important academic restrictions automatically
4. **TypeScript + Ultracite**: Catches errors early, maintains code quality
5. **shadcn/ui**: Accelerated UI development with accessible components

### Challenges Overcome
1. **Server/Client component split**: Required careful planning to avoid hydration errors
2. **Supabase SSR**: Needed proper cookie handling for auth to work
3. **Swedish terminology**: Preserved official terms while maintaining English codebase
4. **Drag-drop mobile**: Required touch event optimization and fallbacks
5. **Profile validation**: Balanced strictness with flexibility

### What We'd Do Differently
1. **Earlier documentation**: Should have started Memory Bank from day one
2. **Testing setup**: Automated tests would have caught some bugs earlier
3. **Caching strategy**: Should have planned from the start
4. **Database schema**: Could have structured conflict data better

## Maintenance Notes

### Regular Tasks
- **Weekly**: Monitor Vercel deployment status
- **Monthly**: Review and update course database if needed
- **Quarterly**: Security dependency updates
- **As needed**: Bug fixes from user reports

### Update Procedures
1. **Course Data Updates**:
   - Export new data from LiU sources
   - Transform to match schema
   - Import via Supabase SQL or API
   - Run `node scripts/fetch-course-stats.js`
   - Update README statistics

2. **Code Changes**:
   - Create feature branch
   - Make changes with TypeScript + Ultracite compliance
   - Test locally
   - Deploy to Vercel preview
   - Merge to main for production

3. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Update relevant Memory Bank files
   - Update copilot-instructions.md if patterns change
   - Keep activeContext.md current
   - Update progress.md for milestone achievements
