## What's Left to Build

### Deferred Enhancements (Low Priority)

#### Color Theme Migration (~40% Complete)
**Priority**: LOW - Functional but inconsistent
**Status**: Deferred until prioritized by user

**Completed**:
- ✅ Global CSS converted to cyan-teal OKLCH colors
- ✅ ~40% of components using theme-aware colors
- ✅ Core utilities (course-utils, conflict-utils) theme-aware
- ✅ Some components fully converted (FilterPanel, ViewToggle, etc.)

**Remaining Work**:
- [ ] 15+ components with hardcoded amber/air-superiority-blue colors:
  - ProfileStatsCard.tsx
  - ProfileSummary.tsx
  - ProfileSidebarSkeleton.tsx
  - ProfilePinboard.tsx
  - PinnedCourseCard.tsx
  - CourseListItem.tsx
  - CourseCard.tsx
  - And 8+ more components
- [ ] Define or remove custom color classes (picton-blue, air-superiority-blue)
- [ ] Verify theme switching works across all components
- [ ] Test light/dark mode compatibility

**Impact**: Minor - theme switching partially works, not blocking functionality

### Phase 2: Feature Enhancements (Not Planned)
These are documented feature ideas but not currently planned:

- [ ] PDF export for advisor meetings
- [ ] Profile templates for common specializations
- [ ] Course rating/review system
- [ ] Alumni career path examples
- [ ] Timetable conflict detection (scheduling)
- [ ] Prerequisite chain visualization
- [ ] Dark mode implementation
- [ ] Course comparison tool
- [ ] Email notifications for profile changes
- [ ] Profile version history

### Technical Improvements (Not Prioritized)
- [ ] Client-side course caching (React Query/SWR)
- [ ] Profile compression for large selections
- [ ] Optimistic UI updates
- [ ] Service worker for offline support
- [ ] Analytics integration
- [ ] Error tracking (Sentry)
- [ ] Performance monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Automated testing suite

## Known Issues

### Deferred (Non-Critical)
1. **Color Theme Inconsistency**: ~60% of components still use hardcoded colors
   - **Impact**: Medium - theme switching doesn't work for all components
   - **Affected**: 15+ components (ProfileStatsCard, ProfileSummary, CourseListItem, etc.)
   - **Status**: Deferred - not blocking production functionality

### Low Priority
### Low Priority
1. **Database Backup Tables**: Three backup tables from October 31, 2025
   - **Impact**: Low - 2.3 MB disk space, RLS warnings in Supabase advisor
   - **Status**: Scheduled for cleanup after 30-day verification period
   
2. **No Client-Side Course Caching**: Every filter change queries Supabase
   - **Impact**: Minimal - responses consistently < 500ms with current user load
   - **Future**: Consider React Query/SWR if user base grows significantly
   
3. **Mobile drag-drop quirks**: Some Android browsers have inconsistent touch behavior
   - **Impact**: Minor - affects UX on certain older devices
   - **Workaround**: Add/remove buttons available as fallback

4. **Large profile performance**: No optimization for 100+ course selections
   - **Impact**: Low - unlikely use case (students typically plan 15-20 courses)
   - **Mitigation**: localStorage limits prevent extreme cases

5. **Static course data**: Manual database updates required
   - **Impact**: Expected - documented limitation
   - **Process**: Manual updates when LiU publishes course changes annually

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. **Hybrid storage pattern**: Provides excellent UX for both guest and authenticated users
2. **Server-side filtering**: Keeps client bundle small, leverages PostgreSQL performance
3. **Conflict detection**: Catches important academic restrictions automatically
4. **TypeScript + Ultracite**: Catches errors early, maintains code quality
5. **shadcn/ui**: Accelerated UI development with accessible components
6. **Database optimization**: RLS, indexes, and functions provide security and performance
7. **Production API hardening**: Rate limiting, validation, and logging prevent abuse
8. **Related courses optimization**: PostgreSQL function reduces response time from 500ms to <50ms

### Challenges Overcome
1. **Server/Client component split**: Required careful planning to avoid hydration errors
2. **Supabase SSR**: Needed proper cookie handling for auth to work
3. **Swedish terminology**: Preserved official terms while maintaining English codebase
4. **Drag-drop mobile**: Required touch event optimization and fallbacks
5. **Profile validation**: Balanced strictness with flexibility
6. **Next.js 16 migration**: Async request APIs required codebase audit and updates
7. **Database security**: RLS policies needed optimization to avoid performance issues
8. **Production API hardening**: Integrated multiple services (Upstash, Sentry) seamlessly

### What We'd Do Differently
1. **Earlier documentation**: Memory Bank should have started from day one
2. **Testing setup**: Automated tests would have caught bugs earlier
3. **Caching strategy**: Should have planned client-side caching from the start
4. **Database schema**: Could have structured conflict data better
5. **Color system**: Should have established theme-aware design system before building components
6. **Performance baseline**: Should have measured metrics earlier for comparison

## Maintenance Notes

### Regular Tasks
- **Weekly**: Review Sentry error reports for critical issues
- **Monthly**: Check Supabase query performance metrics, review course database accuracy
- **Quarterly**: Security dependency updates, audit Upstash Redis usage
- **Annually**: Update course database when LiU publishes new course catalog
- **As needed**: Bug fixes from user reports, drop backup tables after verification period

   - Make changes with TypeScript + Ultracite compliance
   - Test locally
   - Deploy to Vercel preview
   - Merge to main for production

3. **Documentation Updates**:
