# Active Context

## Current Status
**Date**: October 31, 2025
**Phase**: Production MVP Complete
**Focus**: Documentation and Memory Bank Setup

## Recent Changes (Last Session)
1. ✅ Created `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - Comprehensive AI agent instructions
2. ✅ Created Memory Bank structure (`memory-bank/` directory)
3. ✅ Populated core Memory Bank files:
   - `projectbrief.md` - Project vision and scope
   - `productContext.md` - User experience and features
   - `systemPatterns.md` - Architecture and design patterns
   - `techContext.md` - Technology stack and setup
   - `activeContext.md` - This file (current work focus)

## What's Working
- ✅ Full course catalog with 475 courses from Supabase
- ✅ Server-side filtering and pagination (< 500ms response)
- ✅ Interactive profile builder with drag-and-drop
- ✅ Conflict detection system for mutually exclusive courses
- ✅ Hybrid storage (Supabase + localStorage fallback)
- ✅ User authentication with Supabase
- ✅ Realtime profile sync across sessions
- ✅ Profile validation (90hp total, 60hp advanced)
- ✅ Mobile-responsive UI with touch support
- ✅ Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- ✅ Production deployment on Vercel

## Current Work Focus
### Memory Bank Documentation
**Why**: Establishing comprehensive documentation system for AI agents to maintain project knowledge across sessions.

**Tasks Completed**:
1. Created memory-bank directory structure
2. Documented project brief and product context
3. Mapped system architecture and patterns
4. Captured technical setup and constraints
5. Set up active context tracking

**Next Steps**:
1. Create `progress.md` - Document feature completion status
2. Create `tasks/_index.md` - Task tracking system
3. Update `.github/copilot-instructions.md` if needed
4. Review and validate all Memory Bank files

## Active Decisions
### Documentation Standards
- **Decision**: Use Memory Bank pattern from `memory-bank.instructions.md`
- **Rationale**: Provides structured, consistent documentation that AI agents can rely on
- **Impact**: All future work should update relevant Memory Bank files

### Swedish Terminology Preservation
- **Decision**: Keep all academic terms in Swedish (avancerad nivå, grundnivå, etc.)
- **Rationale**: Official university terminology, prevents confusion in advisor discussions
- **Impact**: Never translate these terms in code or UI

### Hybrid Storage Pattern
- **Decision**: Continue dual-storage approach (Supabase + localStorage)
- **Rationale**: Balances guest user experience with authenticated features
- **Impact**: All profile mutations must go through ProfileContext

## Known Issues
### Technical Debt
1. **No Course Caching**: Every filter change hits Supabase
   - **Impact**: Potential performance issues with many concurrent users
   - **Solution**: Consider React Query or SWR for client-side caching
   
2. **Large Profile Handling**: No optimization for 100+ course selections
   - **Impact**: localStorage might hit limits, UI could lag
   - **Solution**: Implement profile compression or pagination

3. **Mobile Drag-Drop Quirks**: Some Android browsers have touch issues
   - **Impact**: Inconsistent UX on certain devices
   - **Solution**: Add fallback to add/remove buttons

### Feature Gaps (Documented, Not Planned)
- No PDF export for advisor meetings
- No course prerequisites validation
- No timetable conflict detection (scheduling clashes)
- No course rating/review system
- No profile templates for common specializations

## Next Actions
1. **Immediate**: Complete Memory Bank setup
   - Create `progress.md`
   - Create `tasks/_index.md`
   - Review all documentation for accuracy

2. **Short-term**: No active development planned
   - System is stable and production-ready
   - Focus on maintenance and bug fixes

3. **Long-term**: Potential enhancements
   - User feedback collection
   - Performance optimization
   - Feature additions based on student needs

## Important Notes for AI Agents
- **Always read Memory Bank files** before starting any task
- **Update activeContext.md** after significant changes
- **Document new patterns** in systemPatterns.md
- **Never bypass ProfileContext** for profile mutations
- **Preserve Swedish terminology** in all code and UI
- **Test conflict detection** when modifying course addition logic
- **Run Ultracite linting** before committing (`npm run lint`)

## Questions for User
None at this time - Memory Bank setup is clear and straightforward.
