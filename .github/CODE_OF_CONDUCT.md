## Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge
We, the maintainers and contributors of LiTHePlan, are committed to creating a welcoming and productive space for everyone. We pledge to make participation in the project and our community a harassment-free experience for all contributors, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity or expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

### Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing appreciation for effort, even when the outcome is imperfect

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment, including unwelcome direct messages
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Any other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

### Enforcement Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including the repository, issue tracker, pull requests, documentation, and any other community interaction channels. It also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.

### Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the maintainers at security@litheplan.tech. Reports will be reviewed promptly and confidentially. Maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

### Enforcement Guidelines
Maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

1. Correction: Non-judgmental private communication clarifying the inappropriate behavior and providing guidance on how to improve.
2. Warning: A written warning that continued behavior will result in further consequences.
3. Temporary Ban: Temporary removal from participation, interaction, or contribution privileges for a specified period.
4. Permanent Ban: Permanent removal from participation in any project-related activities.
