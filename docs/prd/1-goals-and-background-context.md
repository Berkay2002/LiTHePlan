# **1. Goals and Background Context**

### **Executive Summary**
This project proposes the development of the "Interactive Master's Profile Builder," a web-based application for civil engineering students at Linköping University. The tool aims to solve the problem of students being unaware of the flexibility within their master's programs by providing a platform to discover, combine, and visualize courses from different specializations. By leveraging a direct and accurate dataset from the university, the application will empower students to create unique, customized academic profiles that align with their career goals, ultimately enhancing student satisfaction and engagement.

### **Problem Statement**
Civil engineering master's students at Linköping University face a significant information gap when planning their studies. The university offers a flexible curriculum that allows for combining courses across different specializations, enabling students to build unique, career-focused profiles. However, the current system for discovering these opportunities is fragmented and difficult to navigate.

The primary pain points are:
*   **Lack of a Centralized Tool:** Course information is spread across various university portals and documents, making it difficult to get a holistic view of all available options.
*   **Poor Discoverability:** Without a user-friendly interface to filter and compare courses, students often default to standard specialization tracks, unaware of valuable cross-disciplinary combinations.
*   **Missed Opportunities:** This lack of awareness leads to students missing the chance to tailor their education to specific, modern engineering roles, potentially limiting their career prospects and diminishing the value of their master's degree.
*   **Inefficient Planning:** The manual process of planning a custom profile is time-consuming and prone to errors, discouraging students from exploring options beyond the default path.

The urgency lies in empowering students to take full control of their education. Solving this problem will not only increase student satisfaction but also enhance the reputation of Linköping University's engineering programs by producing graduates with highly specialized and relevant skill sets.

### **Goals & Success Metrics**
#### **Business Objectives**
*   **Increase Awareness:** Make students fully aware of the academic flexibility and cross-specialization opportunities available at Linköping University.
*   **Empower Students:** Provide a tool that empowers students to make informed, personalized decisions about their education.
*   **Enhance Program Value:** Increase the perceived and actual value of the master's programs by facilitating the creation of unique, career-focused skill sets.
*   **Improve Student Satisfaction:** Boost overall student satisfaction by removing a significant point of friction and frustration in academic planning.

#### **User Success Metrics**
*   A student successfully discovers and combines courses from at least two different specializations into a viable study plan.
*   A student feels more confident and knowledgeable about their academic options after using the tool.
*   A student uses the export/share feature to facilitate a discussion with an academic advisor.
*   The time required for a student to create a full master's plan is significantly reduced compared to manual methods.

#### **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
*   **Adoption Rate:** Percentage of first-year civil engineering master's students who create an account and build a profile within the first semester.
*   **Profile Diversity:** The average number of courses per profile that are outside the student's primary specialization.
*   **Task Completion Rate:** Percentage of users who start building a profile and successfully save or export it.
*   **User Satisfaction (NPS/CSAT):** A direct survey metric to gauge how helpful and effective students find the tool.
