# **3. User Interface Design Goals**

### **Proposed Solution**
We propose the "Interactive Master's Profile Builder," a responsive web application designed to transform how Linköping University's civil engineering students plan their master's program. The application will serve as a centralized, dynamic, and highly interactive course discovery and planning tool.

**Core Concept:**
The platform will aggregate all master's level courses from the university-provided dataset into a single, intuitive interface. It moves beyond a static catalog by allowing students to not just view courses, but to actively build, visualize, and refine a custom study plan in real-time.

**Key Differentiators:**
*   **Dynamic Filtering:** A powerful filtering system will allow students to explore the entire course catalog based on multiple criteria (term, block, pace, campus, etc.), revealing combinations they were previously unaware of.
*   **Visual "Pinboard" Builder:** The core of the experience is a "pinboard" or timeline feature where students can select and arrange courses. This provides a clear, visual representation of their custom master's profile, making it easy to see how their choices fit together over time.
*   **Data-Driven Accuracy:** By using a direct data feed from the university, the tool ensures all information is accurate and up-to-date, providing a reliable foundation for academic planning.
*   **Export and Collaboration:** Students can easily export or share their created profiles, facilitating productive conversations with academic advisors, mentors, and peers to validate their choices.

This solution will succeed by directly addressing the current system's shortcomings—poor discoverability and fragmented information—with a single, user-centric platform that prioritizes flexibility and informed decision-making.

### **Target Users**
#### **Primary User Segment: Civil Engineering Master's Students**
*   **Profile:** Students currently enrolled in or about to begin a Master's program in Civil Engineering at Linköping University. They are typically tech-savvy, goal-oriented, and looking to maximize the value of their education.
*   **Current Behaviors & Workflows:** They currently rely on navigating multiple, often confusing, university websites, PDF course catalogs, and word-of-mouth recommendations. Planning is a manual, frustrating process involving spreadsheets or pen and paper to track potential course loads and schedules.
*   **Specific Needs & Pain Points:**
    *   A single, reliable source of truth for all available courses.
    *   An intuitive way to filter and sort courses by various academic criteria.
    *   The ability to visualize how different course choices fit together over the duration of their master's program.
    *   Confidence that their custom-built plan is viable and meets program requirements.
*   **Goals:** To discover interesting courses they were previously unaware of, build a personalized and optimized study plan that aligns with their specific career ambitions, and to feel empowered and in control of their academic journey.

### **Technical Considerations**
#### **Platform Requirements**
*   **Target Platforms:** Web (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile). The application must be fully responsive.
*   **Browser/OS Support:** The latest stable versions of major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
*   **Performance Requirements:** Fast initial page loads (LCP < 2.5s) and instant, lag-free filtering.
