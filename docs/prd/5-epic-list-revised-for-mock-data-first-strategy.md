# **5. Epic List (Revised for Mock-Data First Strategy)**

*   **Epic 1: Foundation & Mock Data:** Establish the core project, define a mock data structure, and build the UI to display it.
*   **Epic 2: Core Application Logic:** Implement all core interactive features (filtering, pinning, validation) using the mock data.
*   **Epic 3: Sharing & Deployment:** Implement the UI for the sharing feature and deploy the mock-data-driven application.
*   **Epic 4: Real Data Integration (Post-Data Arrival):** This epic is blocked until the university data is provided. It involves swapping the mock data source with the live Supabase database.
