# Story 2.1: Implement Filter UI & Logic

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** student,
**I want** to use a filter panel to narrow down the course list in real-time,
**so that** I can find courses that match my needs.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A filter panel is displayed with UI elements for all known filter criteria.
2. Filter options are dynamically generated from the mock data.
3. Applying filters updates the displayed course list instantly.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Create Filter Panel Component (AC: 1)
  - [x] Create `components/course/FilterPanel.tsx` component
  - [x] Define props interface for filter state and callbacks
  - [x] Design filter panel layout using shadcn/ui components
  - [x] Implement filter controls for all course criteria (level, term, campus, pace, etc.)
  - [x] Ensure responsive design for filter panel
- [x] Task 2: Implement Filter State Management (AC: 2, 3)
  - [x] Create filter state interface in main page component
  - [x] Implement filter state using React useState hooks
  - [x] Create filter logic functions to process course data
  - [x] Generate dynamic filter options from mock data
- [x] Task 3: Integrate Filter with Course Display (AC: 3)
  - [x] Update main page to include FilterPanel component
  - [x] Connect filter state to CourseGrid component
  - [x] Implement real-time filtering of course list
  - [x] Add filter reset functionality
- [x] Task 4: Enhance Course Display with Filtering (AC: 3)
  - [x] Update CourseGrid to accept filtered courses array
  - [x] Add "no results" state when filters return empty
  - [x] Display active filter count or summary
  - [x] Ensure smooth transitions when filters change

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Course Card and Course Grid components successfully implemented in `components/course/` directory
- Mock data successfully integrated and displayed on main page
- Course interface from `types/course.ts` provides all necessary fields for filtering
- shadcn/ui components and Tailwind CSS already configured and working
- Main page currently displays all courses from mock data without filtering

### Data Models
The Course interface from `types/course.ts` contains all filterable fields:
```typescript
export interface Course {
  id: string; // Unique identifier, e.g., course code 'TQXX33'
  name: string;
  credits: number; // e.g., 30
  level: 'grundnivå' | 'avancerad nivå';
  term: 7 | 8 | 9;
  period: 1 | 2;
  block: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4;
  pace: '100%' | '50%';
  examination: string[]; // e.g., ['TEN', 'LAB']
  campus: 'Linköping' | 'Norrköping' | 'Distans';
}
```

### Component Specifications
- Filter components should be placed in `/components/course/` directory [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- Use shadcn/ui components for consistent UI design [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- All component props must be explicitly typed using TypeScript [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Use React `useState` hooks for state management [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling (integrates with shadcn/ui) [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

### File Locations
- Filter Panel component: `components/course/FilterPanel.tsx` [Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure-corrected.md]
- Main page: `app/page.tsx` (update existing) [Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure-corrected.md]
- Course Grid component: `components/course/CourseGrid.tsx` (update existing) [Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure-corrected.md]
- Mock data: `data/mock-courses.json` [Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure-corrected.md]
- Course type: `types/course.ts` [Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure-corrected.md]

### Technical Constraints
- All new code must be strongly typed using TypeScript [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Use React 18+ with Next.js 14+ framework [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Follow default Next.js ESLint configuration [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Use React `useState` hooks for state management [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

### UI/UX Requirements
- Implement responsive design for filter panel
- Use shadcn/ui components for consistent, accessible UI
- Provide clear visual feedback when filters are applied
- Handle empty filter results gracefully
- Ensure filter panel is intuitive and easy to use
- Consider mobile-friendly filter layout

### Testing Requirements
- Testing is skipped for rapid development [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Focus on manual testing and validation during development [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Validate TypeScript compilation and component rendering manually
- Test filter functionality with various combinations
- Test responsive design on different screen sizes

## Testing
**Testing Standards:**
- Manual testing and validation during development
- TypeScript compilation validation
- Component rendering and interaction testing
- Filter logic validation with various data combinations
- Responsive design testing on different screen sizes
