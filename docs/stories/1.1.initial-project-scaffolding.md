# Story 1.1: Initial Project Scaffolding

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to set up a new Next.js project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui,
**so that** I have a clean, standardized foundation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A new Next.js project is created and configured with the specified technologies.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript (AC: 1)
  - [x] Create new Next.js project using `create-next-app` with TypeScript template
  - [x] Verify TypeScript configuration in `tsconfig.json`
  - [x] Ensure Next.js version 14+ is installed
- [x] Task 2: Configure Tailwind CSS (AC: 1)
  - [x] Install Tailwind CSS v3+ and its dependencies
  - [x] Configure `tailwind.config.js` for the project
  - [x] Set up `globals.css` with Tailwind directives
- [x] Task 3: Install and configure shadcn/ui (AC: 1)
  - [x] Install shadcn/ui CLI and initialize configuration
  - [x] Configure shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS integration
  - [x] Set up component directory structure (`components/ui/`)
- [x] Task 4: Verify project structure alignment (AC: 1)
  - [x] Ensure project follows unified project structure from architecture docs
  - [x] Create required directories: `components/`, `data/`, `lib/`, `types/`, `styles/`
  - [x] Set up basic file structure according to architecture specifications

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This is the first story in the project, so no previous story context exists.

### Tech Stack Requirements
Based on architecture documentation, the following technologies must be configured:

**Framework & Language:**
- Next.js 14+ [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- TypeScript 5+ [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- React 18+ [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

**UI & Styling:**
- shadcn/ui (Latest) [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Tailwind CSS 3+ [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Project Structure Requirements
The project must follow the unified project structure defined in the architecture:

```
/
├── app/
│   ├── api/
│   ├── page.tsx
│   └── profile/
├── components/
│   ├── ui/          # shadcn/ui components
│   ├── shared/
│   ├── course/
│   └── profile/
├── data/
├── lib/
├── styles/
│   └── globals.css
├── types/
├── .env.local
├── next.config.js
└── tsconfig.json
```

### Coding Standards
- Default Next.js ESLint configuration [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
- All new code must be strongly typed using TypeScript [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
- All component props must be explicitly typed [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]

### File Locations
- Main application page: `app/page.tsx` [Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure-corrected.md]
- Global styles: `styles/globals.css` [Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure-corrected.md]
- TypeScript config: `tsconfig.json` [Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure-corrected.md]
- Next.js config: `next.config.js` [Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure-corrected.md]

### Technical Constraints
- No testing framework required (skipped for rapid development) [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Focus on manual testing and validation during development [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]

## Testing
**Testing Standards:**
- Testing is skipped for rapid development [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Focus on manual testing and validation during development [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- No specific testing requirements for this foundation story
