# Story 1.3: Display Mock Course Catalog

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** student,
**I want** to see a list of all available master's courses from the mock data file,
**so that** I can begin exploring the UI.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The main page directly imports and reads the `mock-courses.json` file.
2. A grid or list of "Course Cards" is displayed, populated with the mock data.
3. Each Course Card shows key information from the mock data.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Course TypeScript interface successfully created in `types/course.ts` with comprehensive JSDoc documentation
- Mock data file `data/mock-courses.json` contains 18 realistic Swedish university course objects
- All course objects conform to the Course interface with proper typing
- Type guard function available for runtime validation in `types/course.ts`
- Test component `components/test-course-import.tsx` validates data structure integration

### Data Models
The Course interface from `types/course.ts` contains all required fields:
```typescript
export interface Course {
  id: string; // Unique identifier, e.g., course code 'TQXX33'
  name: string;
  credits: number; // e.g., 30
  level: 'grundnivå' | 'avancerad nivå';
  term: 7 | 8 | 9;
  period: 1 | 2;
  block: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4;
  pace: '100%' | '50%';
  examination: string[]; // e.g., ['TEN', 'LAB']
  campus: 'Linköping' | 'Norrköping' | 'Distans';
}
```

### Component Specifications
- Course components should be placed in `/components/course/` directory [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- Use shadcn/ui components for consistent UI design [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- All component props must be explicitly typed using TypeScript [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling (integrates with shadcn/ui) [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

### File Locations
- Course Card component: `components/course/CourseCard.tsx` [Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure-corrected.md]
- Course Grid component: `components/course/CourseGrid.tsx` [Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure-corrected.md]
- Main page: `app/page.tsx` [Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure-corrected.md]
- Mock data: `data/mock-courses.json` [Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure-corrected.md]
- Course type: `types/course.ts` [Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure-corrected.md]

### Technical Constraints
- All new code must be strongly typed using TypeScript [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Use React 18+ with Next.js 14+ framework [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Follow default Next.js ESLint configuration [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Use React `useState` and `useContext` hooks for state management [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

### UI/UX Requirements
- Implement responsive design for different screen sizes
- Use shadcn/ui components for consistent, accessible UI
- Display key course information clearly and readably
- Handle empty states gracefully
- Follow modern UI/UX best practices with Tailwind CSS

### Testing Requirements
- Testing is skipped for rapid development [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Focus on manual testing and validation during development [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Validate TypeScript compilation and component rendering manually
- Test responsive design on different screen sizes

## Testing
**Testing Standards:**
- Testing is skipped for rapid development [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Focus on manual testing and validation during development [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Validate TypeScript compilation and component rendering manually
- Test responsive design and data display functionality

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-27

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

Overall, the implementation demonstrates solid React/Next.js development practices with good component architecture and TypeScript usage. The code is well-structured, follows the project's architectural patterns, and successfully implements all acceptance criteria. However, there are several areas where we can improve code quality, maintainability, and user experience.

### Refactoring Performed

I've identified several improvements that can be made to enhance the code quality and user experience:

- **File**: `app/page.tsx`
  - **Change**: Fixed unescaped apostrophes in JSX text content
  - **Why**: React ESLint rule violation that could cause rendering issues
  - **How**: Properly escaped apostrophes using HTML entities

- **File**: `types/course.ts`
  - **Change**: Improved type guard function parameter typing
  - **Why**: Better type safety and follows TypeScript best practices
  - **How**: Changed `any` parameter to `unknown` for safer type checking

- **File**: `components/course/CourseCard.tsx`
  - **Change**: Extracted color utility functions to improve maintainability
  - **Why**: Reduces code duplication and makes color logic more reusable
  - **How**: Created separate utility functions for level and campus color mapping

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ [Minor linting issues fixed - unescaped entities and type safety]
- Project Structure: ✓ [All files properly located according to architecture guidance]
- Testing Strategy: ✓ [Manual testing approach aligns with project strategy]
- All ACs Met: ✓ [All acceptance criteria fully implemented and functional]

### Improvements Checklist

[Check off items you handled yourself, leave unchecked for dev to address]

- [x] Fixed unescaped apostrophes in page.tsx (React ESLint compliance)
- [x] Improved type safety in course.ts type guard function
- [x] Extracted color utility functions in CourseCard for better maintainability
- [ ] Consider adding loading states for better UX
- [ ] Add error boundaries for robust error handling
- [ ] Consider implementing course filtering/search functionality
- [ ] Add accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

### Security Review

No security concerns found. The implementation uses static data and doesn't involve user input or external API calls that would require security considerations.

### Performance Considerations

- **Current**: Good performance with static data loading
- **Considerations**: 
  - Grid layout uses CSS Grid which is performant
  - Card hover effects use CSS transitions (GPU-accelerated)
  - No unnecessary re-renders detected
  - Consider implementing virtualization for large course lists in the future

### Final Status

✓ **Approved - Ready for Done**

The implementation successfully meets all acceptance criteria and demonstrates good React/Next.js development practices. The minor improvements I've made enhance code quality and maintainability. The remaining unchecked items are enhancement suggestions for future iterations rather than blocking issues.
