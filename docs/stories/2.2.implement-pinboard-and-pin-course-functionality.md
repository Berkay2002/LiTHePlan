# Story 2.2: Implement Pinboard and "Pin Course" Functionality

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** student,
**I want** to add courses to a "My Profile" pinboard,
**so that** I can build my study plan.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A "Pinboard" UI with sections for Term 7, 8, and 9 is displayed.
2. Users can add and remove courses from the catalog to their pinboard.
3. The pinboard state is managed on the client-side.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Filter functionality successfully implemented with real-time updates
- Course cards already have "Add to Profile" button placeholder (line 163 in CourseCard.tsx)
- Main page uses React hooks for state management (useState, useMemo)
- FilterPanel and CourseGrid components work well with shared state pattern
- shadcn/ui components provide consistent styling and responsive design

### Data Models

#### Course Interface (Existing)
From `types/course.ts` - already implemented and validated:
```typescript
export interface Course {
  id: string; // Unique identifier, e.g., course code 'TQXX33'
  name: string;
  credits: number; // e.g., 30
  level: 'grundnivå' | 'avancerad nivå';
  term: 7 | 8 | 9;
  period: 1 | 2;
  block: number | [number, number];
  pace: '100%' | '50%';
  examination: string[];
  campus: 'Linköping' | 'Norrköping' | 'Distans';
  programs: string[];
}
```

#### Profile Interface (To be created)
For `types/profile.ts`:
```typescript
export interface StudentProfile {
  id: string; // Generated UUID for profile
  name: string; // Profile name (e.g., "My Master's Plan")
  created_at: Date;
  updated_at: Date;
  terms: {
    7: Course[];
    8: Course[];
    9: Course[];
  };
  metadata: {
    total_credits: number;
    advanced_credits: number;
    is_valid: boolean;
  };
}

export interface ProfileState {
  current_profile: StudentProfile | null;
  is_editing: boolean;
  unsaved_changes: boolean;
}
```

### Component Specifications
- Profile components should be placed in `/components/profile/` directory
- Use existing CourseCard pattern for consistency in PinnedCourseCard
- Integrate with existing FilterPanel and CourseGrid components
- Maintain responsive design patterns from existing components
- Use shadcn/ui components (Card, Button, Badge, Sheet) for consistency
- Follow TypeScript strict typing requirements

### File Locations
- Profile types: `types/profile.ts` (new)
- Profile components: `components/profile/ProfilePinboard.tsx` (new)
- Pinned course card: `components/profile/PinnedCourseCard.tsx` (new)
- Profile utilities: `lib/profile-utils.ts` (new)
- Main page: `app/page.tsx` (update existing)
- Course card: `components/course/CourseCard.tsx` (update existing)

### Technical Constraints
- All new code must be strongly typed using TypeScript
- Use React 19+ with Next.js 15+ framework (App Router)
- Follow default Next.js ESLint configuration
- Use React `useState` and `useContext` hooks for state management
- Client-side state management only (no external state library)
- Use localStorage for persistence (no database integration yet)

### UI/UX Requirements
- Implement responsive design for pinboard (mobile-first)
- Use shadcn/ui components for consistent, accessible UI
- Provide clear visual feedback for pin/unpin actions
- Show real-time updates when courses are added/removed
- Handle empty pinboard state gracefully
- Display course information clearly in pinboard layout
- Ensure smooth transitions and animations
- Consider drag-and-drop UX patterns for future enhancement

### Profile Business Rules
- Each term (7, 8, 9) can contain multiple courses
- No duplicate courses across all terms
- Course term validation: courses should match their designated terms
- Maximum credit validation (optional): reasonable limits per term
- Profile persistence: save to localStorage with unique profile ID
- Profile naming: allow users to name their study plans

### Integration Points
- Update existing CourseCard "Add to Profile" button (line 163)
- Integrate with existing filter state management pattern
- Work with existing course data structure and mock-courses.json
- Maintain existing pagination and course grid functionality
- Ensure compatibility with existing responsive design breakpoints

### Testing Requirements
- Testing is skipped for rapid development
- Focus on manual testing and validation during development
- Validate TypeScript compilation and component rendering manually
- Test pinboard functionality with various course combinations
- Test responsive design on different screen sizes
- Test localStorage persistence across browser sessions
- Validate profile state management edge cases

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient re-rendering with React.memo if needed
- Optimized localStorage operations
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Proper cleanup of event listeners and effects

## Testing
**Testing Standards:**
- Manual testing and validation during development
- TypeScript compilation validation
- Component rendering and interaction testing
- Profile state management validation
- Pin/unpin functionality testing with various course combinations
- Responsive design testing on different screen sizes
- localStorage persistence testing across browser sessions
- Profile validation logic testing (duplicates, term matching)
